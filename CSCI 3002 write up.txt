Best Ideas

1. Wearable + 3D Modeling [By far my best idea and something I have put some thought into and would be something I actually would pursue and try to prototype because it is something that is developed but not easily accessible and something that can be majorly improved and innovated. This idea will involve "wearable" and "3D Modeling/Printing. If you could take your normal phone case and/or tablet and turn it into a working desk station. A case that has a extendable back pop out that turn it into an adjustable stand that is elevated to your liking. You then simply turn the case on that is connect to your phone/tablet via the usb cable and it projects a laser keyboard onto a flat surface. The keyboard can be customized to your preference with both size of keys and exactly what ever keys/commands you choose. This would take the hassle out of carrying a large case that are only made for tables with physical keyboard that keys are too small and close to each other. The modern cases for tablets that have physical keyboards are bulky and also only provide a few different viewing settings while an adjustable pop up stand from the rear of the case would give you endless options.]

2. 3D Modeling + Drone [The idea is to create a drone that has a small working lever arm that can pick small things up and hold them without failure and be able to deliver them where told via an address, gps pin location or a set location told by the user. EX) "Drone...put my watch on my desk"   Drone: "take this plate of cookies to the neighbors two houses down. Using an AI system similar to siri or alexa you could have the drone be controlled via that as well/or an app that a user gives input and direction too.]

Other ideas:

1. 3D Modeling and Wearable Tech [The idea is to create a pen that not only write in ink or pencil but have a sensor built into them that records hand movement and wireless translates to an output source that is readable/viewable. ]

2. 3D Modeling + wearable tech [The idea of making a phone case that connect to your phone that will be more accurate than the phones step counter but also includes more functions such as reading the internal heat of your body, heart rate, calories burned, etc all while protecting your phone via the case shell]

3. 3D Modeling and Wearable Tech [The idea is to create an ankle bracelet that can record your vital signs, sleep patterns, and most of all your steps more accurately.]

4. 3D Modeling and Wearable Tech [The idea is to create finger caps for gloves that let you use your phone or tablet screen in wet or snowy conditions with ease. Soon to come after would be toe caps for certain "situations".]

5. 3D Modeling + Drone[The idea is to create a drone that carries a variety or sensors including air pressure, direction, temperature, humidity and etc. very high up in the air and stop at different elevations to see any changes and report back to the app it comes with.]

6. 3D Modeling and Wearable Tech [The idea is to create ]

7. [a sentence]

8. 3D Modeling + Drone[The idea of this is too 3d model toys for dogs and use drones to play with the dog with such toys that hang from it or have a way to fly off real fast and drop a ball speed or lease the toy if the hanging town would be too much force to bring down the drone.]
